The goal of this project is to:

 - Store quiz question and answer data in a file
 - Construct a question model that contains one question and the correct answer
 - Create a class that will operate as the "quiz brain". The class will need to:
    * ask questions 
    * capture users answer
    * check if user guessed the correct answer
    * inform user if their response is correct 
    * show user how many questions they have gotten correct out of total number of questions asked
    * check to see if there are questions remaining in the stored quiz data and ask the next question if unanswered questions remain
    * once all questions have been asked and answered, show the user their final score
